# 🧭 React Routing Practice Project

This project was created to **learn and practice React Router** — a powerful library for handling navigation and routing in React applications.

---

## 🚀 Overview

The app demonstrates how to:

* Set up a **React Router** environment.
* Create multiple **pages/components** (like Home, Shop, Men, Women, Contact, etc.).
* Use **`<Link>`** and **`<Route>`** for navigation.
* Pass **props** through routes.
* Manage **active states** in navigation (highlighting the selected menu).

---

## 🧩 Features

* 🏠 **Home Page**
* 🛍️ **Shop and Category Pages** (Men, Women, Kids)
* 🧑‍💻 **Login Page**
* 🛒 **Cart Page**
* 📞 **Contact Page**
* Navbar with active link highlighting
* Clean and modular component structure

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **React.js**
* **React Router DOM (v6)**
* **CSS** for styling

## 🧠 What I Learned

* How to use **`BrowserRouter`**, **`Routes`**, and **`Route`**.
* The difference between **relative** and **absolute** paths.
* Handling **dynamic routes** (like `/product/:id`).
* Structuring a small multi-page React app.
